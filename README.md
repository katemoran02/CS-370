# CS-370

Project Overview
In this project, I developed a reinforcement learning agent to navigate a simulated environment as a pirate searching for treasure. I was provided with a basic framework that included environment setup and state representation. My primary contributions involved implementing the agent’s decision-making process using Q-learning, fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal learning, and improving the reward system to encourage efficient navigation.

Connecting Learning to Computer Science
The Role of Computer Scientists
Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing algorithms, developing software, and leveraging artificial intelligence. In this project, reinforcement learning was used to simulate decision-making, a concept that has real-world applications in robotics, finance, and game development.

Problem-Solving Approach
I approached this project using the scientific method—understanding the problem, implementing an initial solution, testing, and refining based on performance metrics. Debugging and experimentation played a major role in improving the agent’s learning efficiency.

Ethical Responsibilities
Ethical considerations are crucial when developing AI models. Bias in training data, unintended consequences of autonomous decision-making, and data privacy must always be considered. Ensuring AI systems are fair, transparent, and accountable is an essential responsibility in the field.

Conclusion
This project reinforced my understanding of reinforcement learning and its real-world applications. It also highlighted the importance of iterative problem-solving and ethical considerations in AI development.
